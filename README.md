Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments are widely used for the characterization of biological macromolecules in
solution. SAXS patterns contain information on the size and shape of dissolved particles in nanometer resolution. Here
we propose a novel method for primary SAXS data analysis based on the application of artificial neural networks (NN).
Trained on synthetic SAXS data, the feedforward neural networks are able to reliably predict molecular weight and
maximum intraparticle distance (Dmax) directly from the experimental data. The method is applicable to data from
monodisperse solutions of folded proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins, and nucleic acids. Extensive tests on
synthetic SAXS data generated in various angular ranges with varying levels of noise demonstrated a higher accuracy and
better robustness of the NN approach compared to the existing methods. The training/validation/test data sets are
